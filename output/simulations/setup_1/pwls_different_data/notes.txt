for some reason I can have iota space with a dummy and retracting Y = logq - 2q.T logq, X =(I - 2q.T) X 
See commit ... 

I thin what happens is that (P - qqt) = (I - iq.T)P (I - iq.T) And hence whenever I make it so
that W is not equal to (P-qqt) then it is essentially irrelevant what the weight matrix is. 

So I must still conclude that it is infeasible to P-qqt and it cannot be equated with using P. 

But evaluating (P-qqt) at the true values does seem to get some of the parameters correct, but 
not all, and the prediction errors are zero. So it indicates that there must be some of the data that is
in the null space of (P-qqt).
